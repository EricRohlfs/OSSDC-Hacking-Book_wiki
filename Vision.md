# Intent and motive

OSSDC Initiative was created to bring together the best open source technologies and open research to allow anyone (not only experts) build affordable self driving cars and autonomous mobile robots in a DIY manner, from toy size (RC cars) to full size (full size cars).

# Role of the book

This book will collect/explain/demo, in an ongoing manner, (being continually updated to latest) tools, blueprints, technologies and components, that could be used to achieve this vision.

# Role of the community

Another important motive of the initiative, is to bring together as many people interested in [Learn, Teach, Invent, Make!](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LearnTeachInventMake) in this fascinating autonomous robots space.
